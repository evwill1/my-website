        <h3>Gear for astrophotography</h3>
        <p>The equipment required for take photo of the night sky can be as simple as a camera and tripod some setups
            can be
            so complicated they can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Let's go through some of the popular pieces of
            equipment for tracking and imaging objects of the night sky.</p>
        <p>Camera: DSLR or Mirrorless Camera: These cameras offer manual settings and interchangeable lenses, crucial
            for
            astrophotography. Models like the Canon EOS 6D are popular among enthusiasts</p>
        <p>Dedicated astro cameras: Dedicated astronomy cameras, often referred to as astro cameras, are specialized
            devices
            designed specifically for capturing celestial objects. Unlike standard DSLR or mirrorless cameras, these are
            engineered to meet the unique challenges of astrophotography.</p>
        <p id="lens">Lens: Wide-Angle Lens: Ideal for capturing expansive night sky vistas, such as the Milky Way.
            Telephoto Lens:
            Suitable for photographing the moon and planets.</p>
        <p>Mounts and Trackers: Star Tracker: A device that compensates for Earth's rotation, allowing longer exposures
            without star trails. The Sky-Watcher Star Adventurer is a favored choice. Equatorial Mount: For more
            advanced
            setups, an equatorial mount provides precise tracking, essential for deep-sky objects.</p>
        <p>Telescope: Refractor or Reflector Telescope: Enhances the ability to capture detailed images of distant
            celestial
            objects.</p>
        <p>Accessories: Intervalometer: Enables timed exposures and reduces camera shake. Light Pollution Filter: Helps
            mitigate the effects of urban lighting. Portable Power Supply: Ensures your equipment remains powered during
            extended sessions. Dew Heaters: Prevents moisture buildup on lenses and telescopes.</p>
