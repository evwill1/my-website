        <h3>Software for astrophotography</h3>
        <h4>Aquisition</h4>
        <p>Aquiring images requires some form of software known as image capture or aquisition software. Some software
            is free while others can cost hundreds of dollars. Depending on the needs of the photographer, you may be
            able to just use free capture software. </p>
        <h4>Here is a list of aquisition software</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Astro Photography Tool (APT)</li>
            <li>NINA</li>
            <li>Sequence Generator Pro</li>
            <li>SharpCap</li>
            <li>ZWO ASI Studio (using ASIAir, Pro, or Plus)</li>
            <li>Backyard EOS (for Canon Cameras)</li>
            <li>Backyard Nikon (for Nikon Cameras)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="tracking">Tracking</h4>
        <p>For a more automated process, guiding software is necessary for tracking. Tracking software is used to
            control a motorized telescope mount to remain fixed on the target object as the camera takes many photos
            with as little errors as possible so images come out nice and clean.</p>
            <!-- One link that opens a different website in a different browser tab or browser window  -->
        <p>The most popular tracking software in the field is <a href="https://openphdguiding.org/" target="_blank">PHD2</a>.</p>
        <h4>Stacking</h4>
        <p>After a night of imaging a photographer is left with a tens, possibly hundreds of images in a .RAW or .FITS
            file type. These are uncompressed and unprocessed image files that contain the valuable image data even if
            the do not look like it. This is where stacking software comes in for the win. These softwares use
            intelligent algorithms to detect and align stars within a photo and literally stack them together. This is
            useful for two reasons-1. it removes unwanted artifacts such as satellite and plane trails. and 2. it
            enhances the details of the target object by increasing the signal in the photo.</p>
        <h4>Popular stacking software includes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>DSS: deep sky stacker</li>
            <li>WBPP: Weighted Batch Pre-Processing (This is a script contained within Pixinsight processing software)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Processing</h4>
        <p>Processing is the last step in the processing of creating a astrophoto. This is the point where the
            photographer gets to express their artistic side while maintaining some scientific dedication. The
            processing phase usually includes cropping, rotating, background extraction, gradient removal, histogram and
            curves transformation, and color balancing.</p>
        <h5>The most popular programs for processing are:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Pixinsight</li>
            <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
            <li>Siril</li>
            <li>Gimp</li>
        </ul>
