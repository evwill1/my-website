            <h4>Aquisition</h4>
            <p>Aquiring images requires some form of software known as image capture or aquisition software. Some
                software
                is free while others can cost hundreds of dollars. Depending on the needs of the photographer, you may
                be
                able to just use free capture software. </p>
            <h4>Here is a list of aquisition software</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Astro Photography Tool (APT)</li>
                <li>NINA</li>
                <li>Sequence Generator Pro</li>
                <li>SharpCap</li>
                <li>ZWO ASI Studio (using ASIAir, Pro, or Plus)</li>
                <li>Backyard EOS (for Canon Cameras)</li>
                <li>Backyard Nikon (for Nikon Cameras)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="tracking">Tracking</h4>
            <p>For a more automated process, guiding software is necessary for tracking. Tracking software is used to
                control a motorized telescope mount to remain fixed on the target object as the camera takes many photos
                with as little errors as possible so images come out nice and clean. The most popular tracking software
                in the field is <a href="https://openphdguiding.org/" target="_blank">PHD2</a>.</p>
            <h4>Stacking</h4>
            <p>After a night of imaging a photographer is left with a tens, possibly hundreds of images in a .RAW or
                .FITS
                file type. These are uncompressed and unprocessed image files that contain the valuable image data even
                if
                they do not look like it. This is where stacking software comes in. These softwares use
                intelligent algorithms to detect and align stars within a photo and literally stack them together. This
                is
                useful for two reasons. First, it removes unwanted artifacts such as satellite and plane trails. Second, it
                enhances the details of the target object by increasing the signal in the photo. This is commonly know as the signal-to-nosie ratio.</p>
            <h4>Popular stacking software includes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>DSS: deep sky stacker</li>
                <li>WBPP: Weighted Batch Pre-Processing (This is a script contained within Pixinsight processing
                    software)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <div id="right">
            <h4>Processing</h4>
            <p>Processing is the last step in the processing of creating a astrophoto. This is the point where the
                photographer gets to express their artistic side while maintaining some scientific dedication. The
                processing phase usually includes cropping, rotating, background extraction, gradient removal, histogram
                and
                curves transformation, and color balancing.</p>
            <h5>The most popular programs for processing are:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Pixinsight</li>
                <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
                <li>Siril</li>
                <li>Gimp</li>
            </ul>
